# SSR and Server components

Note: this is not the best way to do this and is meant as a illustrative example of how you can use server components and SSR together. A proper implementation would hoist imports like React the RSC payload, have proper templating, and would do more than hydrate static HTML.

## Setup

- `npm install`

## Running the sample

-   `npm start`
