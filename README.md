# React Serving Patterns

This is a repo that contains a collection of ways to serve React apps. The focus of this repo is to provide the most simple examples of how to serve a React app while still being useful examples and following best practices where possible. The purpose of these examples is aid in the learning process of React Server Components.

## List of serving patterns

### Platform agnostic

-   [Hydration](https://github.com/mattcarrollcode/react-serving-patterns/tree/main/hydration)
-   [Static SSR](https://github.com/mattcarrollcode/react-serving-patterns/tree/main/static-ssr)

### Node.js

-   [Streaming](https://github.com/mattcarrollcode/react-serving-patterns/tree/main/node-streaming)
-   [Streaming with shell](https://github.com/mattcarrollcode/react-serving-patterns/tree/main/node-streaming-with-shell)
-   [Streaming with suspense](https://github.com/mattcarrollcode/react-serving-patterns/tree/main/node-streaming-with-suspense)
-   [Server components](https://github.com/mattcarrollcode/react-serving-patterns/tree/main/node-server-components)

### Web Streams (aka edge runtime)

-   Translate all Node.js examples to Web Streams
-   Get Node.js [SSR with hydration](https://github.com/mattcarrollcode/react-serving-patterns/tree/main/WIP-node-ssr-with-hydration) working
-   Write readme for each example
